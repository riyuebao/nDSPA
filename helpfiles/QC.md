**QC & Filter**

QC is an important step when importing raw count data. When selecting this option, data will be normalized to ERCC controls automatically. You will have the option to filter out any reads which do not meet your criteria. Default options are a standard set of filters for removing regions with low nuclei counts and surface area or reads which do not fit within standard ranges for Positive Control Factor, Binding Density or FOV. 

It may be important to look at your data with filters applied and adjust the thresholds while viewing plots. All data under "Data Plots" will update in real time! To utilize scaling without any filters, toggle the "Filter Data" switch to the off position.
