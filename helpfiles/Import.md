**Importing Files**

*Currently only tab-delimited text files (TSV) are accepted by the application.*

Input files should be a standard GeoMX software data export (*.xlsx) . To make a tab-delimited file, open the exported file from GeoMX with Microsoft Excel. Click File > Save as. Under the options for filetype, set it to "Text (tab delimited) (*.txt)"

After importing your data you may immediately view any plots generated under the "Data Plots" button in nDSPA. If your data requires QC, Filtering, Scaling or Normalization you may toggle the sliders located below the data importer. Your plots under "Data Plots" will change in real time! Any data manipulations to your input data will be applied application wide with the various tools within nDSPA.


Thank you for using our application!
